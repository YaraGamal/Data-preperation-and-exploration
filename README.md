Kindly create a new Talend job to do the following:
• read the content of IMDB.csv file

• read the content of IMDB.json file
• merge the data collected from the above three files into a new dataset
• filter the records that has MetaCritic value as "NA"
• save the output as CSV
• build the Talend job, and make sure that you can run the exported scripts
Some notes:
• to can read excel file in Talend, you can depend on "File Excel" section from Metadata
• make sure that the output CSV file (the merged one) contains different 58 columns in any order
Please deliver the following:
• the exported files from building the Talend job
• also, right-click on the job → export items → and share with me
• screenshots of what you achieved
• the output CSV file
